## Purpose

The cohort help finder, or Teach Me g59, provides a way for students from g59 to find fellow students who can help them work through various problems and exercises.

Teach Me g59 uses the GitHub GraphQL API to search through gschool repositories and find g59 students who have made pull requests on those repositories.

To use, just enter the GitHub project name of the project you need help with, and you will receive a list of students who have made pull requests on that repository and would likely be able to help you. If the list returns empty, no students have made pull requests.
